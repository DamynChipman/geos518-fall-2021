# GEOS 518: Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems<br>Fall 2021

### Professor: Alejandro (Lejo) Flores

This is the repository for the Fall 2021 instance of GEOS 518: Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems. This repository contains important resources (principally Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown files) that we will use throughout the class. You may want to Watch and Star this repository. 

Particularly important materials provided here include:
* The class [syllabus](./SYLLABUS.md)

### Student: Damyn Chipman

This is my local repo of the class repo. See each module in `mod0*` for my solutions.

### GOLDFISH: GeOphysicaL Domain FInite element Simulation Hub

As a companion to this course, I will be developing any multiphysics apps and problems using the [MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/index.html) multiphysics package from Idaho National Lab. MOOSE stands for Multiphyics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment, and the name does well at explaining with it does. It's a finite element, multiphysics package written in C++ for easy multiphysics app development.

My repo with geophysics kernels, materials, boundary and initial conditions, applications and problems can be found in the [GOLDFISH repo](https://github.com/DamynChipman/Goldfish).
