# GEOS 518: Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems

## Fall 2021

## Prof. Alejandro N. Flores

This repository contains a variety of code, mostly in the form of Jupyter notebooks, in support of Modeling Earth and Environmental Systems for the Fall 2021 semester. The structure of this repository mirrors that of the class structure found in Canvas, with folders for individual modules. Each module's folder contains a number of examples that pertain to the module topic, as well as the template Jupyter notebook for the associated assignment. Each folder also starts with a README that describes each notebook in the folder.
