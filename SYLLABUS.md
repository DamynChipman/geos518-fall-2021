### Course Description


### Required Materials

### Course Expectations

### Computer Access:

### Attendance:
* According to Boise State University policy, “You are responsible for attending courses for which you are enrolled. You are also responsible for making up any work you may have missed by failing to attend class, even if the absence was approved by the university, necessitated by illness, or necessitated by a personal emergency. In this sense, then, there are no “excused” absences.” 
* Due to the nature of the class, watching recorded videos and lectures is a poor substitute for attending and participating in in-class activities.
* Please note that absences reduce your potential for class participation, and therefore, may reduce that portion of your grade.
* In-class activities may include graded and ungraded checks of assigned online lectures/reading.
* Class starts on time.  I make announcements, answer questions, and give reminders immediately at the beginning of class. 

### Outside of Class:
* You are expected to read all emails and announcements.  
* The class reading/lecture/homework/exam schedule will be updated on Canvas.  It is your responsibility to make sure you are staying up to date.
* Come prepared for class by watching the assigned online lectures. ***Online quizzes*** are due prior to the designated class period.  (See grading section for details.)
* If you need help, get it now!  I am always willing to meet with you and go over questions or concerns. ***Do not wait until the end of the semester.***

### Academic Dishonesty:
Cheating or plagiarism in any form is unacceptable. All work submitted by a student must represent their own ideas, concepts, and current understanding. Beware the internet; if you can find it, so can your professor. Academic dishonesty also includes submitting substantial portions of the same academic coursework to more than one course for credit without prior permission of the instructor(s). Please be aware of your rights and responsibilities as a student by reviewing the Boise State Student Code of Conduct: [https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/)

### Educational Access for All Students:
Students with additional educational and access needs are encouraged to contact the proper resource as early as possible (Boise State Educational Access Center; [https://www.boisestate.edu/eac/](https://www.boisestate.edu/eac/)). The EAC assists Boise State staff and faculty in meeting accommodations mandated by Federal and State law and University policy. They will work with you to identify and document physical and learning needs and identify  appropriate accommodations for a student in their courses.

Quizzes are... 
Each quiz is 10 questions and you will have 20 minutes to complete each quiz. You may take each quiz twice, but the recorded score will always be the final score (i.e., not the highest - think about whether you really want to retake the quiz to get 1 additional point). Quizzes are open-book but not collaborative. You are responsible for checking the schedule on Blackboard and keeping up with deadlines.  Make sure you are using a reliable Internet connection.  You are allowed one attempt at each quiz.  Your lowest quiz score will be dropped before final grades are calculated.
