### Course Description


### Required Materials

### Course Expectations

### Computer Access:

### Attendance:
* According to Boise State University policy, “You are responsible for attending courses for which you are enrolled. You are also responsible for making up any work you may have missed by failing to attend class, even if the absence was approved by the university, necessitated by illness, or necessitated by a personal emergency. In this sense, then, there are no “excused” absences.” 
* Due to the nature of the class, watching recorded videos and lectures is a poor substitute for attending and participating in in-class activities.
* Please note that absences reduce your potential for class participation, and therefore, may reduce that portion of your grade.
* In-class activities may include graded and ungraded checks of assigned online lectures/reading.
* Class starts on time.  I make announcements, answer questions, and give reminders immediately at the beginning of class. 

### Outside of Class:
* You are expected to read all emails and announcements.  
* The class reading/lecture/homework/exam schedule will be updated on Canvas.  It is your responsibility to make sure you are staying up to date.
* Come prepared for class by watching the assigned online lectures. ***Online quizzes*** are due prior to the designated class period.  (See grading section for details.)
* If you need help, get it now!  I am always willing to meet with you and go over questions or concerns. ***Do not wait until the end of the semester.***
