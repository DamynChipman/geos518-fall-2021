### Course Description:


### Required Textbook:
The following textbook is required for the class. It is fairly easy to find and reasonably priced: 

_Slingerland, Rudy and Kump, Lee_ (2011), Mathematical Modeling of Earth's Dynamical Systems: A Primer, Princeton University Press, 248 pp. | [Buy on Bookstore.org](https://bookshop.org/books/mathematical-modeling-of-earth-s-dynamical-systems-a-primer/9780691145143) | [Buy on Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Modeling-Earths-Dynamical-Systems/dp/0691145148) | 

### Computer Access:
Being a numerical modeling class, access to computing resources is critical. Ideally, you would have access to a laptop computing that has internet access and on which you can install the required computing tools (`Python`, `JupyterLab`, and `git`, ideally via a package manager like `conda`). I acknowledge, however, that as Graduate Students your ability to procure a laptop that you can bring to class may be limited. If you need help finding access to a laptop for class, please contact me. There are a number of ways I can help. Chromebooks are potentially an option, but you will need to use Jupyter in cloud computing environment like    

### Recommended Software:
If you have experience in installing scientific computing software, or feel confident enough to try, the following software are the minimum you will need at the outset of the class. New requirements may arise throughout the semester, but you will have built some capabilities to install them. This class is committed to using only open source software and open science principles. 

* `Python 3`. I ___highly___ recommend you install via `Miniconda` or `Anaconda`. I also ___highly___ recommend that you create a new `conda` environment specifically for the class.
  * `Miniconda` installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux devices can be found here: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
  * `Anaconda` installers for Windows, Mac, and Linux devices can be found here: [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)
* `Jupyter`. For interactive computing and programming via your web browser. 
* `Numpy`. For numerical and mathematical computing.
* `Matplotlib`. For visualization and plotting results. 
* `Scipy`. For some more advanced statistical analysis. 
* `Pandas`. For data analysis, particularly time series analysis.

__A note on Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).__ Some students, particularly those having familiarity with Matlab, will find IDEs helpful to aid in the transition from Matlab to Python. A number of IDEs are available for development in Python, some of which come bundled with installers like `Anaconda`. These can be helpful in providing an experience that is familiar but, in my experience, can often lead users to develop less-than-helpful habits as scientific programmers. We will using primarily Jupyter notebooks, which allow you to program and intersperse blocks of code with descriptive text and are used exclusively in a browsered environment. Please try to stick with the Jupyter notebook computing environment (you will be required to submit assignments as Jupyter notebooks), even though it may seem a bit foreign at first. 

### Course Expectations:
This class has a mixed structure wherein the Tuesday class will be primarily lecture and the Thursday class with be a coding workshop. In the Thursday coding lab we will review example code that I have developed for each topic we cover in the class. Depending on how well you are able to understand, execute, and modify the example code you may also have time to get started on the associated assignment for each module.  

We will develop community expectations as a class, but it is important that we cultivate and maintain an inclusive and supportive environment. As such we will adhere to the Code of Conduct developed by the Software Carpentry Foundation that can be found at [https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

### Attendance:
* According to Boise State University policy, “You are responsible for attending courses for which you are enrolled. You are also responsible for making up any work you may have missed by failing to attend class, even if the absence was approved by the university, necessitated by illness, or necessitated by a personal emergency. In this sense, then, there are no “excused” absences.” 
* Due to the nature of the class, watching recorded videos and lectures is a poor substitute for attending and participating in in-class activities.
* Please note that absences reduce your potential for class participation, and therefore, may reduce that portion of your grade.
* In-class activities may include graded and ungraded checks of assigned online lectures/reading.
* Class starts on time. I make announcements, answer questions, and give reminders immediately at the beginning of class. 

### Outside of Class:
* You are expected to read all emails and announcements.  
* The class reading/lecture/homework/exam schedule will be updated on Canvas. It is your responsibility to make sure you are staying up to date.
* Come prepared for class by watching the assigned online lectures. ***Online quizzes*** are due prior to the designated class period (see grading section for details).
* If you need help, get it now! I am always willing to meet with you and go over questions or concerns. ***Do not wait until the end of the semester.***

### Academic Dishonesty:
Cheating or plagiarism in any form is unacceptable. All work submitted by a student must represent their own ideas, concepts, and current understanding. Beware the internet; if you can find it, so can your professor. Academic dishonesty also includes submitting substantial portions of the same academic coursework to more than one course for credit without prior permission of the instructor(s). Please be aware of your rights and responsibilities as a student by reviewing the Boise State Student Code of Conduct: [https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/)

### Educational Access for All Students:
Students with additional educational and access needs are encouraged to contact the proper resource as early as possible (Boise State Educational Access Center; [https://www.boisestate.edu/eac/](https://www.boisestate.edu/eac/)). The EAC assists Boise State staff and faculty in meeting accommodations mandated by Federal and State law and University policy. They will work with you to identify and document physical and learning needs and identify  appropriate accommodations for a student in their courses.

### Grading Summary (proportions may vary by up to 5%)

| Component | Proportion of Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Online Reading Quizzes | 15% |
| Jupyter Notebook Assignments | 60% |
| Module-end Reflection | 5% |
| Modeling Project | 20% |

#### Online Reading Quizzes (15%)
Quizzes are... 
Each quiz is 10 questions and you will have 20 minutes to complete each quiz. You may take each quiz twice, but the recorded score will always be the final score (i.e., not the highest - think about whether you really want to retake the quiz to get 1 additional point). Quizzes are open-book but not collaborative. You are responsible for checking the schedule on Blackboard and keeping up with deadlines.  Make sure you are using a reliable Internet connection.  You are allowed one attempt at each quiz.  Your lowest quiz score will be dropped before final grades are calculated.  

#### Jupyter notebook Assignments (60%)


#### Module-end Reflection (5%)


#### Modeling Project (20%)
